ebay-listing-software
=====================

A simple ebay listing software using eBay Trading API.

The live demo is http://listers.in/

This is still under development.
I'm building this software as my personal project for purposes of learning following technologies:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Backbone.js
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap
- eBay Trading API

Directories:
- "node" directory contains server side scripts which run on Node.js.
- "node/routes/ebayapi" directory contains modules which call eBay Trading API.
- "node/views" directory contains html files handled by Express.js framework.
- "webroot/js/node" directory contains client side scripts of Backbone.js framework.
